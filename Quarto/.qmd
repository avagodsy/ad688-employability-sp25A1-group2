## Literature Review

In this report, researchers Alekseeva et al. recapped their findings on the demand for AI skills in the U.S. economy. The authors point out that it can be difficult to find data regarding companies’ demand for AI skills, so they used job posting data. They defined AI job postings as those that included “artificial intelligence”, “machine vision”, “deep learning” or “speech recognition”.

They found that larger firms (measured by market capitalization, cash holdings, and investments in R&D) tended to pay more of a premium for AI skills. Firms with more demand for AI skills also offered high salaries in non-AI jobs than firms with less demand for AI skills.

The results also showed that while IT-related industries have the highest demand for AI skills, there is significant growth across a wide range of industries outside of IT as well. Across all industries, AI skills hold an average of an 11% wage premium. The job with the largest premium is Management; the authors surmise that this means AI has the greatest value when combined with organizational knowledge.

Within this paper, authors Pabilonia and Vernon outline differences in compensation for remote and in-office roles. Using data from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS), they note that remote work has increased in the U.S. since 2020 (linked to the COVID-19 pandemic), and importantly, “remote workers in most occupations earned a wage premium.”

In 2021, there was a 13.3% premium for remote work versus in-office work. Wages are determined by factors such as job tasks, productivity differences, job amenities, search frictions, and monopsony power. They also note a wage disparity in principal cities of large metropolitan areas (MSAs), with a 12.6% wage premium compared to 14.5% in areas outside the 15 largest MDAs.

Another paper discusses the locale for the highest-paid jobs within the U.S. Using data from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics program, the authors demonstrate clear connections between location and salary. Regions in major metropolitan areas have wage premiums up to 18% higher than national averages.

However, these higher wages are offset by the cost of living, particularly housing. The conclusion is that despite wage premiums in major cities, workers may not enjoy higher net consumption due to high living costs.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), total employment is projected to grow by 4 percent between 2023 and 2033. The number of jobs is expected to increase from 167.8 million to 174.6 million. Half of these gains will come from sectors like healthcare and scientific/technical services, while retail may lose jobs.

Industries that will see the most significant wage growth from 2023 and 2033 are those that will have a strong demand for specialized labor. Healthcare and social assistance jobs will see a rise in high paying roles such as nurse practitioners and physical therapists assistants. This sector will experience continued growth due to skill labor shortages and aging population. The scientific and technical services sector is expected to grow by 10.5% and it includes high paying roles such as software developers, cybersecurity professionals and data scientists. Renewable Energy industries sector will see an increase in jobs over the years as demand for photovoltaic installers and wind turbines service technicians is increasing and are expected to be hired at competitive rates.
