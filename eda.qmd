<!-- Each team member should list their current skills relevant to their selected IT career path.
Use a numerical scale (1-5) to indicate proficiency levels:
1 = Beginner
2 = Basic knowledge
3 = Intermediate
4 = Advanced
5 = Expert -->

## Team Skill Level Dataframe
```{python}
import pandas as pd

skills_data = {
    "Name": ["Ava", "Mahira", "Joshua"],
    "Python": [#, 3, 3],
    "SQL": [#, 1, 4],
    "Machine Learning": [#, 3, 2],
    "Cloud Computing": [#, 1, 1]
}

df_skills = pd.DataFrame(skills_data)
df_skills.set_index("Name", inplace=True)
df_skills
```

## Visualizing Skill Gaps with Seaborn
```{python}
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.heatmap(df_skills, annot=True, cmap="coolwarm", linewidths=0.5)
plt.title("Team Skill Levels Heatmap")
plt.show()
```
